DropTalk
==========

The idea of games having increasingly good odds for a rarer drop happening for
a given player based off of the number of non-rare drops they have received.
The longer you can keep you players engaged and playing your game the better.
One easy way to accomplish this is to make sure they feel rewarded for the time
they spend playing.

NOTE: This is currently unfinished, but the stream provides the concept of what
      we are attempting here (the math is currently off... horribly).

Some portions of the class have been left purposely incomplete for users to
fill in if they so choose.

Twitch?

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
